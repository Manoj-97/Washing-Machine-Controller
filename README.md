# Washing-Machine-Controller
The controller checks for the input of coin. If the lid is close, then turning on wash will enable the controller to perform the required steps like soak, rinse, spin. 
Each process is carried out for a certain amount of pre-defined time.
The inputs to the controller are mapped to the swtiches of a Spartan 3E FPGA. And the output is mapped to the on-board motor and LED's of the Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA kit.
